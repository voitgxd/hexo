Dear, This is my first time to write a english love letter for you.<br/>
In the short of a life, there is always someone silently have walked into you heart.<br/>
You, just like a fairy, fly to me bring countless happiness and tears.<br/> 
You are fond of asking me that whether you looks beautiful or not. I regularly respond to a smile.<br/>
As a matter of fact, it's in my heart that there is no need to speak, because, the answer is given everyday.<br/>
During these days, I toughly find there is nothing to represent how important you weigh for me.<br/>

You have been irreplaceable for me and I will be your inclusive star int the night sky.<br/>
Look at the stars when waling at night, this person who are over you look down on you from the shinning.<br/>
So when you feel alone, just remember, that this lovely guy will always be there to guide you and keep a breast
with you to pull through life's pain and sorrow.<br/>
My girl, I love you!

At last, listen carefully the love music I pick up for you.
